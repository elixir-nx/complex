# Complex

*Complex* is a library for types and mathematical functions for complex
numbers.

Each complex number is represented as a structure holding the real and
imaginary part.  There are functions for creation and manipulation of
them.  Unfortunately since there is no operator overloading in Elixir the
math functions (add, subtract, etc.) are implemented as add/2, sub/2, etc.

## Installation

Add *complex* as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [ { :complex, "~> 0.2.0" } ]
end
```
After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile
Complex. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix` and try the examples
in the [examples section](#examples).

## Documentation

Documentation for the package is available online via Hex at
[http://hexdocs.pm/complex](http://hexdocs.pm/complex).  You can also generate
local docs via the mix task
```elixir
mix docs
```
This will generate the HTML documentation and place it into the `doc` subdirectory.

## Examples
```elixir
iex> Complex.new(3, 4)
%Complex{im: 4.0, re: 3.0}

iex> Complex.new(0, 1)
%Complex{im: 1.0, re: 0.0}
```
